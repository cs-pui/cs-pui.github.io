Despite their research-intensive PhDs, many graduates [find academic happiness with **primarily-undergraduate institutions**](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-jobs-i-didnt-see-my-misconceptions-of-the-academic-job-market-9cb98b057422) because of the compelling balance they offer between teaching and research. But the pathways to these positions is often not clear (_how do I find these jobs?_), and often requires insider knowledge of a landscape that is invisible to PhD students. This listing is meant to help navigate that muddy water. [See archived listings from previous years](faq#archive).

This document does _not_ contain most CS faculty positions. It's specifically intended for people who want to invest in teaching/mentorship with undergraduate students while still staying active in their scholarship. See our [**Resources**](resources) page for insight into the ways in which PUIs might differ in their interviewing processes and values.
