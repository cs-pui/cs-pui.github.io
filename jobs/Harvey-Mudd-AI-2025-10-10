The Computer Science Department at Harvey Mudd College (HMC) is pleased to announce an opening for an assistant professor of artificial intelligence commencing July 1, 2026. Exceptional candidates at higher ranks are welcome to apply. Successful candidates should have completed a Ph.D. in a relevant field by the time of appointment. The candidate will be expected to provide students with vibrant AI research experiences and develop innovative AI curricula and programming that support AI education across all departments at HMC and beyond.  In addition to offering courses at the forefront of AI technological advances, such as Generative AI or Deep Learning, the candidate will be expected to have a clear vision for how their research and teaching address the ethics and social impacts of AI.
