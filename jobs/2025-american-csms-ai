The Departments of Computer Science and Mathematics & Statistics in the College of Arts and Sciences at American University invite applications for a full-time, tenure-track assistant professor position with a focus in data science or artificial intelligence beginning August 1, 2026. Applicants should have a PhD or an anticipated PhD completion by August 2026 in computer science, data science, statistics, mathematics, or a related field. American University is a private nonprofit institution in the suburbs of DC. While both departments provide opportunities to work with graduate students, we primarily focus on undergraduate education and mentorship. Candidates should be effective teachers and must be strongly committed to excellence in scholarly research and student mentorship. We envision a faculty member who can teach a 2-2 load across Computer Science and Mathematics & Statistics and who can demonstrate potential to secure external funding to support their research agenda. In addition to scholarship and teaching, responsibilities will include participation in department, school, and university activities and service.
