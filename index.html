<p>Despite their research-intensive PhDs, many graduates <a href="https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-jobs-i-didnt-see-my-misconceptions-of-the-academic-job-market-9cb98b057422">find academic happiness with <strong>primarily-undergraduate institutions</strong></a> because of the compelling balance they offer between teaching and research. But the pathways to these positions is often not clear (<em>how do I find these jobs?</em>), and often requires insider knowledge of a landscape that is invisible to PhD students. This listing is meant to help navigate that muddy water. <a href="faq#archive">See archived listings from previous years</a>.</p>
<p>This document does <em>not</em> contain most CS faculty positions. It’s specifically intended for people who want to invest in teaching/mentorship with undergraduate students while still staying active in their scholarship.
