üí° You can email `jcrouser@smith.edu` if you run into any problems or need help.

While we often post positions quickly after they are publicized, departments can also add their own advertisements to the site. **Make sure your department and university aligns with the website criteria**. [See the criteria](/#sec-criteria) for more information.
 
There are two options: 
1. You can add your information by **editing our Github repository** (and eventually creating a pull request). _Follow the instructions on the page below._
2. Or if you're uncomfortable about making changes here, you can email `jcrouser@smith.edu` and Jordan will happily post your ad for you.
